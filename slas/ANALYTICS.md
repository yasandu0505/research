1. Do a demography study, age, gender, etc. on each grade. 
There are a few ideas we need to work on. 

A. First thing is to identify what are roles played by each person. 
How many such unique roles are there. This will give us a clear
understanding on how SLAS officers are assigned to work on various jobs. 

B. The second part of this is to also understand the age wise grouping for
each job role. Also age wise classification on each grade. 

C. We also want to know the clearance on each Grade as a function of time. 
The main idea is to identify a so-called performance metric who became
a Super grade officer compared to time. And this applies for each level. 
Also understand average time spent on each grade given a person. We have
to understand this across the whole data set we have for all grades. 

2. Ministry or Department Level Analysis

We have to understand in each Department or Ministry how many SLAS officers
are there. And how many of them are in each grade. We also want to understand
the age wise distribution of SLAS officers in each Department or Ministry.

3. SLAS Officer Tracking

We need to find where this officer worked in his career in each Grade. This is a
time sensitive information as there is a time they are promoted and the place they
work could be subjected change as well. 
Their qualification and profile information can be retrieve from 
https://www.sasa.lk/members. 
This has each year who joined and what they did. Some of them have updated their 
work history as well. So you can get that information cleanly extracted from there. 

4. We need to plot each officer on a Map and visualize them moving across place to another with reference to time. We should have a centralized view where we can pick the officer can visualize it.
