# gztprocessor

A Python library for tracking and versioning structural changes in Sri Lankan government gazettes, with optional FastAPI backend.

Supports:
- **MinDep**: Ministries and Departments (structural changes: ADD, TERMINATE, MOVE)
- **Person**: Person-portfolio assignments (appointments, removals)

---

## Features

- Process extracted details for ministries/departments and person-portfolio assignments (JSON format)
- Detect and classify transactions: `ADD`, `TERMINATE`, `MOVE`, `RENAME`
- Maintain versioned state snapshots for rollback/history
- Output CSVs for transactions (to seed Neo4j)
- [Optional] Expose a FastAPI backend for interactive review and state management

---


## Package Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sehansi-9/gztprocessor.git
# or, for development:
pip install -e .
# To enable API features:
pip install "git+https://github.com/sehansi-9/gztprocessor.git#egg=gztprocessor[api]"

```

---

## Optional: Running the FastAPI Backend

If you want to use the interactive API:

1. Install API dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install gztprocessor[api]
   ```

2. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. The API exposes endpoints for loading, reviewing, applying, and resetting state.  
   See the **API Endpoints** section below.

## Running the full project with frontend

Fork the repository on GitHub to your own account.

Clone your fork locally and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gztprocessor.git
cd gztprocessor
```
2. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages for both core functionality and API support:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install nltk rapidfuzz fastapi uvicorn
```
3. Run the FastAPI Backend

Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000

4. Setup and Run the Frontend

Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, install dependencies, and start the development server:
```bash
cd gztp-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
You can now access the frontend application in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5173).

## Error Handling

- The API returns JSON error messages for missing files, invalid requests, or not found resources.
- Always check the response for an `error` key if your request fails.
- The backend prints warnings to the console for missing or duplicate data.

---

## Developer Notes

- The system relies on department/person position for parsing and matching (for mindep)
- MOVEs are inferred by matching omitted/added names
- RENAMEs are detected for person gazettes when ministry/portfolio names change 
- Input/output file naming conventions are important (see `utils.py`)
- **Stemming, Fuzzy Matching, and Scores:**
  - For person gazettes, the system uses stemming (via NLTK's PorterStemmer) and fuzzy string matching (via RapidFuzz) to compare ministry/portfolio names.
  - Fuzzy matching computes a similarity score (token sort ratio) between new and existing ministry/portfolio names.
  - If the score exceeds a threshold (default 70) or there is word overlap, the system suggests possible terminates for adds and moves.
  - These suggestions, along with their scores, are included in the API response to help users review and confirm transactions.

---

## Testing

- Use `curl` or Postman to test endpoints (if using the API)
- See `input/` for sample gazette files and dates/gazette numbers
- See `request_body/` for sample request payloads
- See https://github.com/sehansi-9/test-gztprocessor for a sample use of gztprocessor
