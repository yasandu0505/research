# Transplantation of Human Tissues Act, No. 48 of 1987

An Act to provide for the **removal and transplantation of human tissues and organs** in Sri Lanka. Enacted in 1987, this Act establishes the legal framework for organ donation (both post-mortem and living), defines **brain death** (irreversible cessation of all brain functions), creates a multi-layered **consent framework**, prohibits the **commercialisation** of human tissues, and establishes the **Technical Advisory Council on Human Tissue Transplantation** to advise the Minister. The Act has remained unamended for 37 years.

### Regenerative Tissue — Family Restriction (Section 8)

Living donation of **regenerative tissue** (e.g., blood, bone marrow) is permitted only for transplantation to a **member of the donor's family**. "Family member" is defined in S.23 (interpretation section).

## Unclaimed Bodies (Section 12)

Where a body remains **unclaimed for 7 days** after death, a prescribed officer may authorise the removal of tissue for transplantation purposes. This provision applies at government hospitals and prescribed institutions.

## Prohibition on Commercialisation (Section 17)

:::warning Ministerial Loophole
No person shall sell, deal in, or offer for sale any human tissue. However, Section 17(2) provides an exception: the Minister may give **prior written approval** for the sale of human tissue. This loophole has been criticised by reform advocates as undermining the spirit of the prohibition.
:::

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **General prohibition** | No sale, dealing, or offering for sale of human tissues (S.17(1)) |
| **Exception** | Prior written approval of the Minister (S.17(2)) |
| **Penalty** | Fine up to Rs. 10,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years (S.17(3)) |

## Confidentiality (Section 18)

The identity of both **donors and recipients** must not be disclosed except as required by law. Contravention is a criminal offence.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Protection** | Identity of donor and identity of recipient |
| **Disclosure allowed** | Only as required by law |
| **Penalty** | Criminal offence for unauthorised disclosure (S.18(2)) |

## Conflict of Interest (Section 16)

The medical practitioner who **certifies death** cannot participate in the subsequent transplantation procedure.

| Rule | Detail | Section |
|------|--------|---------|
| **General rule** | Certifying doctor excluded from transplantation | S.16(1) |
| **Cornea exception** | Certifying doctor may authorise cornea removal | S.16 proviso |
| **Penalty** | Criminal offence for contravention | S.16(2) |

## Penalties

| Offence | Penalty | Section |

| Removing tissue from living person contrary to S.7-8 | Criminal offence (penalty not specified in accessible text) | S.13 |
| Certifying doctor participating in transplantation | Criminal offence (penalty not specified in accessible text) | S.16(2) |
| Sale or dealing in human tissues without Ministerial approval | Fine up to Rs. 10,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years | S.17(3) |

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Reform calls — age threshold**: Persistent advocacy to lower the living donor age from 21 to 18, aligning with other jurisdictions
- **Penalty adequacy**: Rs. 10,000 fines (set in 1987) are widely regarded as insufficient deterrent; no inflation adjustment in 37 years
- **Section 17 loophole**: The Ministerial written approval exception to the commercialisation ban has been criticised as potentially enabling organ trafficking
- **Organ trafficking protections**: The Act predates modern organ trafficking conventions and lacks specific anti-trafficking provisions
- **Advisory Council activity**: Whether the Technical Advisory Council has been actively convened and what recommendations it has made is unknown
- **Current membership**: Names and composition of the current Advisory Council are not publicly documented
- **Regulations made under S.19**: Whether regulations have been gazetted and their content is not publicly compiled
- **Brain death protocols**: Whether detailed clinical protocols implementing S.15 have been issued by the Ministry
- **Transplant statistics**: Number of transplantations performed under this Act is not publicly tracked in accessible sources
- **International alignment**: How this Act compares with WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation
