# Health Services Act, No. 12 of 1952

The Health Services Act is the foundational legislation for public health governance in Sri Lanka. Enacted in 1952, it established a three-tier governance structure: a national Health Council, Regional Hospitals Boards, and Hospital Committees. The lower two tiers were effectively superseded by the Provincial Councils system in 1989.

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Operational Status**: Does the Health Council still meet monthly as mandated?
- **Current Members**: Who are the current Health Council members?
- **Formal Repeal**: Were Sections 9-20 (Regional Boards, Committees) formally repealed or just made obsolete by devolution?
- **Transition Documents**: Where are the 1989 devolution transition records?
- **Paywall Content**: Sections 6-23 on srilankalaw.lk require paid access
