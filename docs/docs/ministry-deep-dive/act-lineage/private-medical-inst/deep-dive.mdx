Enacted in 2006, this Act repeals the Nursing Homes (Regulations) Act, No. 16 of 1949 (Chapter 220) and creates the modern regulatory framework for private healthcare.

- **Body corporate:** Perpetual succession, own seal, may sue and be sued (S.7)
- **Seal custody:** Secretary; use requires authorisation by both Chairman and Secretary (S.8)

## Registration Process

Registration is administered through Provincial Directors, who act as intermediaries between applicants and the PHSRC.

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Application** | To the Provincial Director of Health Services in prescribed form with prescribed fee (S.3(1)) |
| **Provincial review** | Provincial Director forwards application to Council with recommendations (S.3(2)) |
| **Fee remittance** | Provincial Director remits 50% of registration fee to Council (S.3(3)) |
| **Council decision** | Council approves or rejects registration |
| **Non-compliance** | Council may direct unregistered institutions to cease operations (S.4) |

### Transitional Provisions

Institutions operating before the Act's commencement had a **3-month window** to apply for registration (S.5). The repealed Nursing Homes (Regulations) Act's registrations carried over during this transition period (S.21).

## Objects and Functions (Sections 9-10)

### Objects (S.9)
The Council's primary objects are to:
- Develop standards, norms, and methods for evaluating the performance of private medical institutions
- Promote quality in private healthcare delivery

### Duties and Functions (S.10)
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Quality assurance | Implement quality assurance and quality improvement programmes (S.10(a)) |
| Staffing standards | Develop standards for staffing levels and qualifications (S.10(b)) |
| Data collection | Collect and maintain data on private medical institutions (S.10(c)) |
| Grading | Grade registered institutions based on standards (S.10(d)) |

## Accreditation Framework (Section 13)

The Minister may, on the recommendation of the Council, approve accreditation schemes for private medical institutions. Key features:

- **9-month advance notice:** Institutions must be given at least 9 months' notice before an accreditation scheme takes effect
- **Voluntary to mandatory:** The scheme allows a transition from voluntary to mandatory accreditation
- **Implementation status:** Unknown — no publicly available evidence of accreditation schemes being gazetted

:::note Research gap
Whether any accreditation schemes have been approved under Section 13 is unknown. This is a significant gap given the Act's emphasis on quality standards.
:::

## Inspection Powers (Section 14)

Section 14 grants broad inspection powers:

- **Scope:** Any authorised officer may enter and inspect any private medical institution
- **Notice:** No prior notice required
- **Timing:** At any time by day or night
- **Patient privacy:** The Act does not explicitly restrict access to patient medical records (contrast with Nursing Homes Act S.6(3) which prohibited inspection of patient records)

:::caution Privacy concern
Unlike the repealed Nursing Homes (Regulations) Act of 1949, which explicitly protected patient medical records from inspection (S.6(3)), this Act does not contain an equivalent patient privacy safeguard. This is notable given the broad inspection powers in Section 14.
:::

## Penalties (Section 16)

| Offence | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Operating unregistered institution | Fine up to Rs. 50,000 |
| Continuing offence | Imprisonment up to 6 months |
| Corporate liability (S.17) | Executive officers deemed guilty unless due diligence proven |

:::note
The Rs. 50,000 fine represents a significant increase from the repealed Nursing Homes Act (Rs. 50), but may still be inadequate as a deterrent for large private hospital operators given modern revenue scales.
:::

## Cross-References

### Nursing Homes (Regulations) Act, No. 16 of 1949 — Repealed

Section 21 **fully repeals** the Nursing Homes (Regulations) Act (Chapter 220). The 1949 Act's Nursing Homes Advisory Board (7 members) is replaced by the PHSRC (28 members). A 3-month transition period was provided for existing registered institutions.

### Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927

The SLMC Registrar serves as an ex-officio member of the PHSRC (S.6(2)(d)), providing a direct link between medical practitioner regulation and private institution regulation.

### Ayurveda Act & Homoeopathy Act — Exclusions

Section 20 (Interpretation) defines "private medical institution" to exclude institutions operating exclusively under the Ayurveda Act (No. 31 of 1961) or the Homoeopathy Act (No. 7 of 1970). These traditional medicine institutions have their own regulatory frameworks.

<EntityRelationshipView data={analysisData} />

## Definitions (Section 20)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Private Medical Institution** | Any premises used for the diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons, operated by a person other than the Government; excludes Ayurveda and Homoeopathy institutions |
| **Accreditation** | A process of evaluation by which an institution is recognised as meeting prescribed standards |
| **Council** | The Private Health Services Regulatory Council established under Section 6 |
| **Provincial Director** | Provincial Director of Health Services |
| **Authorised officer** | Any person authorised by the Council for purposes of inspection |

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Accreditation implementation**: Whether any accreditation schemes have been gazetted under Section 13
- **Registration statistics**: Number of institutions currently registered; how many were transitioned from the 1949 Act
- **Fee schedule**: Current registration fees (both initial and renewal) — not publicly documented
- **PHSRC meeting records**: No publicly available minutes or annual reports
- **Grading system**: Whether the institutional grading system under S.10(d) has been implemented
- **Complaint mechanisms**: How patient complaints about private institutions are handled
- **Rules made under S.19**: Whether the Council has exercised its rule-making power on infrastructure and staffing standards
- **Patient privacy**: Whether any administrative guidelines address the gap in patient record protection during inspections (S.14)
- **Fee adequacy**: Whether the Rs. 50,000 penalty ceiling (S.16) is sufficient as a deterrent for large private hospitals
