## Registration Requirements

### Mandatory Registration

No premises shall be used as a nursing home unless registered under the Act (S.2). Operating an unregistered nursing home is an offence.

### Registration Process

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Application** | To the Director-General of Teaching Hospitals (originally Director of Health Services; amended 1988) in prescribed form |
| **Initial fee** | Rs. 10,000 (originally Rs. 100; amended by No. 62 of 1988) |
| **Outcome** | Director registers the nursing home and issues a certificate |
| **Certificate** | Must be displayed conspicuously on the premises |
| **Validity** | 12 months from date of registration |
| **Renewal fee** | Increased by No. 62 of 1988 (originally Rs. 50) |

### Refusal and Cancellation Grounds

The Director may refuse or cancel registration on the following grounds (S.4):

- The applicant/proprietor is not a fit and proper person
- The premises are not suitable for use as a nursing home
- The nursing home is not, or will not be, under adequate staffing

**Safeguard:** Before cancellation, the Director must give written notice specifying the grounds and allow the proprietor a reasonable opportunity to remedy the issue (S.4(3)).

## Staffing Requirements

The Act distinguishes between two types of nursing homes with different staffing requirements:

| Type | Superintendent Requirement |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Maternity home** | Must be a registered nurse or registered midwife (S.3(4)(b)) |
| **General nursing home** | Must be under a qualified medical practitioner or a registered nurse resident on the premises (S.3(4)(a)) |

## Regulation-Making Powers

Section 7(2) gives the Minister broad power to make regulations on the following matters:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Construction standards | Building construction and maintenance of nursing homes |
| Ward size | Number of patients per ward or room |
| Staffing | Number and qualifications of nursing and other staff |
| Infectious disease | Precautions against spread of infectious disease |
| Immunization | Immunization requirements |
| Fees/charges | Rates, fees, and charges at nursing homes |
| Records | Keeping of records and registers |
| Inspection | Conduct of inspections |
| General | Any other matter for the proper maintenance and running of nursing homes |

**Parliamentary approval:** All regulations must be approved by Parliament (S.7(3)).

## Inspection Powers and Privacy Protection

The Act balances inspection powers with patient privacy (S.6):

**Powers of entry:**
- Director of Health Services or any authorised medical practitioner or nurse may enter and inspect any registered nursing home at any reasonable time
- May also inspect any unregistered premises suspected of being used as a nursing home

**Privacy safeguard:**
- Inspectors **cannot** inspect individual patient medical records (S.6(3))

**Obstruction:** Obstructing an inspector is an offence (S.6(4)).

## Penalties

| Offence | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Operating unregistered nursing home | Fine up to Rs.50 |
| Continuing offence | Rs.20 per day |
| Contravention of regulations | Fine up to Rs.50 + Rs.20/day continuing |
| Corporate liability | Directors/officers deemed guilty unless they prove no knowledge (S.8(2)) |

:::note
The penalty amounts (Rs. 50 fine, Rs. 20/day) reflect 1949 values. Unlike the registration fees (updated by Amendment No. 62 of 1988), the penalty amounts have not been amended and are negligible in modern terms.

## Cross-References

### Private Medical Institutions (Registration) Act, No. 21 of 2006

The 2006 Act established a modern regulatory framework for private healthcare institutions, including the **Private Health Services Regulatory Council (PHSRC)** in 2007. This Act is the successor legislation for private healthcare regulation and may partially or fully supersede the 1949 Act's regulatory functions.

:::caution
Section 21 of the 2006 Act (repeals and savings) is paywalled. It is unknown whether the 1949 Act has been partially or fully repealed by the 2006 Act.
:::

### Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927

The definitions of "registered midwife" and "registered nurse" in Section 11 reference the Medical Ordinance. The staffing requirements (S.3(4)) depend on these registration categories.

## Amendment Timeline

<AmendmentTimeline data={analysisData} />

### Amendment No. 62 of 1988 — Fee Increase

Endorsed 17 December 1988. Significantly increased registration and renewal fees to reflect inflation since 1949:

| Fee | Original (1949) | Amended (1988) |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| Initial registration | Rs. 100 | Rs. 10,000 |
| Annual renewal | Rs. 50 | Increased (exact amount in amendment text) |

### Amendment No. 63 of 1988 — Director Redefined

Endorsed 17 December 1988. Redefined the term "Director" in the interpretation section (S.11) from **Director of Health Services** to **Director-General of Teaching Hospitals**. This change shifts regulatory authority for nursing homes and affects:

- **Registration** (S.3): Applications now go to the Director-General of Teaching Hospitals
- **Refusal/cancellation** (S.4): Decision-maker changed
- **Inspection** (S.6): Authorising officer changed
- **Advisory Board chairmanship** (S.9): Chairman is now the Director-General of Teaching Hospitals

:::note Consolidated text header discrepancy
The consolidated text header lists "Acts Nos. 16 of 1949, 12 of 1952, 29 of 1953" as the source acts. However, Act No. 12 of 1952 is the [Health Services Act](https://www.parliament.lk/en/business-of-parliament/act-details/G5364) and Act No. 29 of 1953 is the [Assignment of Ministers' Functions (Consequential Provisions)](https://www.parliament.lk/en/business-of-parliament/acts-listing?actNo=29/1953). Neither is a direct amendment to the Nursing Homes Act. The actual amendments are Nos. 62 and 63 of 1988, identified from parliament.lk records.

## Entity Relationships & Governance

<EntityRelationshipView data={analysisData} />

## Definitions (Section 11)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Director** | Director-General of Teaching Hospitals (amended by No. 63 of 1988; originally Director of Health Services) |
| **Maternity home** | Premises used for the reception of women during pregnancy or confinement |
| **Nursing home** | Premises used for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from illness or injury (excludes government/local authority premises and prescribed bodies) |

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Consolidated header discrepancy**: The consolidated text header references Acts 12/1952 and 29/1953 but neither is a direct amendment (the actual amendments are Nos. 62 and 63 of 1988) — the nature of the header references needs clarification
- **Repeal status**: Whether Section 21 of the Private Medical Institutions (Registration) Act, No. 21 of 2006 partially or fully repeals this Act
- **Current enforcement**: Whether the Director of Health Services still registers nursing homes under this Act or whether PHSRC has assumed this function
- **Advisory Board activity**: Whether the Nursing Homes Advisory Board still convenes; current membership unknown
- **Regulations made**: Which regulations have been made under Section 7, and whether they are still in force
- **Registered nursing homes**: Number of currently registered nursing homes under this Act
- **Penalty adequacy**: The Rs.50 fine is negligible in modern terms; whether there have been any prosecutions under the Act
