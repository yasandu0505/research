# Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No. 17 of 1929

An Ordinance to amend and consolidate the law relating to poisons, opium, and dangerous drugs. Enacted in 1929, this is Sri Lanka's principal drug control legislation — a large, multi-chapter ordinance with severe penalties including the death penalty (introduced 1984). Unlike most other health legislation, this Ordinance covers three distinct regulatory domains: poisons, opium, and dangerous drugs.

## Ordinance Structure

The Ordinance is organised into six chapters with three schedules:

| Chapter | Topic | Key Provisions |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| I | Definitions & General Provisions | Interpretation, application, scope |
| II | Poison Regulations & Restrictions | Licensing for sale of poisons (First Schedule); labelling and storage requirements |
| III | Opium Control & Distribution | Director's authority for opium distribution (S.35); Second Schedule provisions |
| IV | Dangerous Drugs Provisions | Import, export, manufacture, sale, and possession of dangerous drugs; Third Schedule classification |
| V | Cannabis/Hemp Preparations | Specific provisions for cannabis and hemp preparations |
| VI | Transit & Transport | Regulation of transit and transport of controlled items |

### Schedules

| Schedule | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **First Schedule** | Lists poisons in Parts I, II, and III — categorised by toxicity and restriction level |
| **Second Schedule** | Opium distribution provisions — governs lawful distribution channels |
| **Third Schedule (Part I)** | Dangerous drugs classified in Groups A, B, C, D, E — each group with different restriction levels |
| **Third Schedule (Part III)** | Trafficking thresholds and penalties — added by Amendment No. 13 of 1984, updated by No. 41 of 2022 |

## Key Provisions

### Poisons (Chapter II)

The Ordinance regulates the sale of poisons through a licensing system. Poisons are categorised in the First Schedule into three parts based on toxicity and restriction level. Key requirements:

- Sale of poisons restricted to licensed sellers
- Labelling and storage requirements
- Record-keeping for sales of scheduled poisons
- Penalties for unlicensed sale

### Opium Control (Chapter III)

Opium distribution is controlled through the Director's authority under S.35:

- Director has discretionary authority for opium distribution (amended by No. 26 of 1986)
- Distribution limited to licensed channels per the Second Schedule
- Import and export restrictions

### Dangerous Drugs (Chapter IV)

Dangerous drugs are classified in the Third Schedule into five groups:

| Group | Examples | Restriction Level |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **A** | Heroin, cocaine | Highest — trafficking subject to death penalty |
| **B** | Morphine, opium derivatives | High — severe penalties |
| **C** | Cannabis, cannabis resin | High — significant penalties |
| **D** | Codeine-based preparations | Moderate — regulated supply |
| **E** | Other controlled substances | Moderate — regulated supply |

:::note
Methamphetamine ("Ice") was added to the dangerous drugs list by Amendment No. 41 of 2022.

## Penalty Framework

The penalty framework has evolved significantly since 1929:

### Original Penalties (1929)

The original Ordinance prescribed fines and imprisonment for violations of poisons, opium, and drug control provisions.

### Death Penalty Introduction (1984)

Amendment No. 13 of 1984 introduced the most severe penalties in Sri Lankan drug legislation:

| Offence | Penalty | Threshold |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Trafficking in heroin | Death or life imprisonment | 2 grams or more |
| Trafficking in morphine | Death or life imprisonment | 3 grams or more |
| Trafficking in cocaine | Death or life imprisonment | 2 grams or more |
| Possession of acetylating substances (S.79A) | Imprisonment | Any quantity |

### Methamphetamine Amendment (2022)

Amendment No. 41 of 2022 expanded the penalty framework:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Methamphetamine added | "Ice" included in dangerous drugs list |
| Uniform threshold | 5g threshold for death penalty across specified drugs |
| Bail restrictions | Updated S.83 — stricter bail provisions for drug offences |
| Evidentiary standards | Enhanced standards for drug-related prosecutions |

:::caution Pending Bill (2024/25)
A bill introduced in 2024/25 proposes S.54AA: prohibiting manufacturing and trafficking on the high seas by Sri Lankan or stateless ships. This bill has not yet been enacted.

## Governance and Enforcement

### Regulatory Chain

The Ordinance does not establish a standalone statutory body. Instead, it operates through:

1. **Minister** — Policy authority: makes regulations, appoints Provincial/District Boards, determines scheduling of controlled substances
2. **Director** — Regulatory authority for opium distribution (S.35); licensing of poison sales; enforcement coordination
3. **Provincial/District Boards** — Appointed by Minister for each province/district; Government Agent serves as chairman; oversee local enforcement

### Related Enforcement Bodies (Separate Legislation)

| Body | Legislation | Role |
|------|-------------|------|
| National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) | Act No. 11 of 1984 | Enforcement and coordination body for dangerous drugs control |
| National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) | Act No. 5 of 2015 | Medicines regulation — regulatory overlap with poisons/drugs provisions |

## Cross-References

### NMRA Act, No. 5 of 2015

The NMRA Act established the National Medicines Regulatory Authority for regulation of the manufacture, import, and sale of medicines. There is regulatory overlap with the Ordinance's provisions on poisons and drug scheduling. The NMRA Act is already in the [Ministry of Health ecosystem](/docs/ministry-deep-dive/health-ministry) with a cross-reference to this Ordinance.

### National Dangerous Drugs Control Board Act, No. 11 of 1984

Enacted in the same year as Amendment No. 13 of 1984, this separate Act established the NDDCB as the principal enforcement and coordination body for dangerous drugs control. The NDDCB works alongside (but is not created by) this Ordinance.

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Additional amendments**: There may be historical amendments between 1929 and 1984 not yet identified — only 3 amendments are confirmed with PDFs
- **Chapter/section mapping**: Detailed section-by-section analysis of the 1929 original text has not been completed
- **Drug scheduling updates**: Whether the schedules have been updated by subsidiary legislation (gazette notifications) beyond the three amendments
- **Enforcement data**: Conviction rates, death penalty sentences carried out, and other enforcement statistics under the Ordinance
- **NDDCB relationship**: Detailed operational relationship between the Ordinance's provisions and the NDDCB Act enforcement mechanisms
- **Provincial/District Boards**: Whether these boards are still actively constituted and functioning
- **Pending bill status**: Current status of the 2024/25 bill proposing S.54AA (high seas jurisdiction)
- **International treaty alignment**: How the Ordinance aligns with UN drug control conventions (1961, 1971, 1988)
