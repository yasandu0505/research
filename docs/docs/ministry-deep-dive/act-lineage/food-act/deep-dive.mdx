# Food Act, No. 26 of 1980

An Act to provide for the **regulation of the manufacture, importation, sale, and distribution of food** in Sri Lanka. Enacted in 1980 to replace the Food and Drugs Act of 1949, this Act is Sri Lanka's primary food safety legislation. It establishes the **Food Advisory Committee** (restructured by Amendment No. 29 of 2011) — a 23-member multi-sector advisory body chaired by the Director-General of Health Services — creates the office of **Chief Food Authority** (DG Health Services, S.11), empowers **local authorities** as food authorities (S.10), and establishes an enforcement regime through **Authorised Officers** (Medical Officers of Health, Divisional Health Officers, Food and Drugs Inspectors — S.13 as amended 1991). The Act has been amended twice: No. 20 of 1991 (24 clauses) and No. 29 of 2011 (FAC restructure).

The analyst system provides the scientific evidence base for food safety enforcement. An authorised officer takes a sample, divides it into parts (one for the owner, one for the analyst, one retained), and submits it for analysis.

## Cross-References

### Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No. 9 of 2003

The Director-General of the Consumer Affairs Authority is an ex-officio member of the Food Advisory Committee (S.8(1)(a)(vii) as replaced by Act No. 29 of 2011). The Consumer Affairs Authority Act overlaps with food pricing and consumer protection aspects.

### Sri Lanka Standards Institution Act, No. 6 of 1984

The Director-General of SLSI is an ex-officio member of the Food Advisory Committee (S.8(1)(a)(viii)). SLSI sets food standards that may be adopted or referenced by regulations made under the Food Act.

### Poisons, Opium & Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No. 17 of 1929

Both acts regulate substances that may be present in or affect food products. The Poisons, Opium & Dangerous Drugs Ordinance controls substances that intersect with food safety (e.g., prohibited additives, contamination).

### National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, No. 5 of 2015

Overlap exists in regulating substances at the food-medicine boundary (nutraceuticals, functional foods, food supplements).

### Food and Drugs Act of 1949 (Repealed)

The predecessor legislation was repealed by Section 31 of the Food Act. The 1949 Act combined food and drug regulation; the 1980 Act separated food regulation into its own statute.

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Regulations under S.32**: Complete list of food safety regulations gazetted under the Act not publicly compiled
- **FAC meeting records**: Whether the Food Advisory Committee has been actively convened and its recommendations are unknown
- **Current membership**: Names and composition of the current FAC (nominated members) not publicly documented
- **Food Commissioner role**: Whether the Food Commissioner position (S.8(1)(a)(xiii)) is currently filled
- **Food standards gazette notifications**: Compilation of food standards prescribed under the Act
- **Enforcement statistics**: Number of prosecutions, convictions, and penalties imposed under the Act
- **Local authority capacity**: Whether all local authorities actively exercise food authority powers; whether Development Councils still exist
- **SLSI coordination**: How food standards set by SLSI interact with standards prescribed under this Act
- **Consumer Affairs overlap**: Delineation of jurisdiction between Food Act and Consumer Affairs Authority Act
- **2011 FAC restructure impact**: Whether the restructured Committee has improved food safety policy outcomes
- **Penalty adequacy**: Whether penalty amounts (last updated 1991) remain adequate deterrents
