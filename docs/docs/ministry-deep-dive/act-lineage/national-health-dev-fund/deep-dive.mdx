- Removed members are ineligible for re-appointment (S.3(5))
- Members who resign may be re-appointed (S.3(6))

**Meeting rules:** The Board sets its own rules for meetings (S.3(10)). No quorum is specified in the Act. Acts or proceedings are not invalidated by vacancies or defects in appointment (S.3(9)).

## Fund Purposes

Section 7 specifies four purposes for Fund disbursement:

| **(b)** Research | Medical and health research |
| **(c)** Disease prevention | Projects for the prevention and control of disease |
| **(d)** Medical equipment/drugs | Procurement of medical equipment and drugs |

### Funding Sources

The Act itself specifies only one source: **gifts and donations** credited to the Fund account (S.6). Historically, additional revenue streams have included:

- **Placenta collection revenue** (1989-1997): Revenue from the collection and export of human placentae was channelled to the Fund
- **Hospital Lottery** (from 1998): 15% of proceeds from the Hospital Lottery directed to the Fund

:::caution Data Confidence: Low
Historical funding source details are based on secondary sources. Current operational status of the Fund, its balance, and active disbursement patterns are unknown.

## Tax Exemptions

| Exemption | Section | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Customs duty | S.13(1) | Goods imported by or on behalf of the Fund are exempt from customs duty |
| Income tax | S.13(2) | Income of the Fund is exempt from income tax (Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979) |
| Wealth tax | S.13(3) | Net wealth of the Fund is exempt from wealth tax |
| Gift tax | S.13(4)-(5) | Gifts to the Fund are exempt from gift tax for both donor and Fund |

## Legal Status Provisions

These provisions subject Fund personnel to criminal liability for corruption and bribery offences.

## Amendment Timeline

<AmendmentTimeline data={analysisData} />

### Amendment No. 17 of 1984 — Borrowing Power

The sole amendment to the Act was certified on 26 April 1984. It makes a single change:

**Section amended:** Section 5 (Powers of the Fund)

**Change:** Inserts new paragraph **(bb)** after paragraph (b), granting the Board of Trustees the power to:

> *"with the concurrence of the Minister borrow by way of loan or otherwise from any bank or lending institution, such sums of money for the purposes specified in section 7 subject to the condition that the total amount of such borrowing shall not exceed the aggregate of its assets in fixed deposit"*

**Significance:** Before 1984, the Fund could only spend what it received as donations/gifts. The amendment enabled the Board to leverage its fixed deposits to borrow additional funds for health purposes — effectively allowing the Fund to amplify its impact beyond passive donation receipts. The Minister's concurrence requirement and fixed-deposit cap provide safeguards against over-borrowing.

### Amendment No. 26 of 1987 — Auxiliary Funds

The second amendment was certified on 21 May 1987. It inserts a new **Section 7A** (Establishment of Auxiliary Funds) with four subsections:

| Subsection | Provision |
|------------|-----------|
| **7A(1)** | The Minister may establish auxiliary funds under the main Fund for specific objectives |
| **7A(2)** | All moneys received by way of gift or donation from private individuals, firms, or institutions (in Sri Lanka and abroad) for specific initiatives shall be credited to corresponding auxiliary funds and applied by the Board per ministerial direction |
| **7A(3)** | The Minister shall appoint **advisory committees** for each auxiliary fund to counsel the Board on fund deployment |
| **7A(4)** | Board member regulations (Section 3 — removal, resignation, vacancy, meeting rules) apply equally to advisory committee members with necessary modifications |

**Significance:** This amendment introduced a sub-fund mechanism allowing targeted donations to be ring-fenced for specific health initiatives rather than pooled into the general Fund. It also created a new category of ministerially-appointed **advisory bodies** — one per auxiliary fund — expanding the governance structure beyond the single Board of Trustees. The advisory committees are subject to the same appointment/removal rules as Board members under Section 3.

## Entity Relationships & Governance

<EntityRelationshipView data={analysisData} />

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Current operational status**: Whether the Board of Trustees is currently meeting and the Fund is actively disbursing
- **Fund balance**: Current balance and recent disbursement history unknown
- **Placenta revenue cessation**: The circumstances and exact date of cessation of placenta collection revenue (reportedly ceased around 1997)
- **Hospital Lottery allocation**: Whether the 15% allocation from Hospital Lottery proceeds is still in effect
- **Board membership**: Current Board members unknown — no recent gazette appointments found
- **Cross-references**: The Act references the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979 for tax exemptions — this Act has since been replaced by newer revenue legislation; whether the exemptions still apply under successor legislation needs verification
