# Medical Wants Ordinance, No. 9 of 1912

The Medical Wants Ordinance is one of the oldest pieces of health legislation in Sri Lanka, enacted in 1912 during British colonial rule. It was designed to consolidate and amend the law relating to the medical wants of labourers in planting districts — specifically estates of 4 or more hectares growing tea, rubber, coffee, coconut, and other plantation crops. The Ordinance created a system where estate proprietors funded medical care for their labourers through export duties, overseen by District Medical Officers and advised by the Medical Wants Committee.

## Statutory Bodies

One statutory body is established by this Ordinance. The Medical Wants Committee has an advisory role, with significant data gaps due to paywall restrictions on Section 25 (composition details).

## Amendment Timeline

The Ordinance has been amended 11 times between 1915 and 1993 — an unusually long amendment history spanning the colonial, post-independence, republic, and modern eras. Most amendments are pre-digital with no accessible text, making this one of the most challenging legislative histories to reconstruct.

## Entity Relationships & Governance

<EntityRelationshipView data={analysisData} />

## Historical Context

The Medical Wants Ordinance reflects the colonial-era plantation economy:

- **Estate definition**: An estate is defined as land of 4 or more hectares planted with tea, rubber, coffee, cocoa, cardamoms, or cinchona — the export crops that drove the colonial economy
- **Funding model**: Medical care was funded through export duties on plantation produce (Chapter VII), creating a direct link between plantation profitability and estate worker health
- **Enforcement**: The Government Agent could seize and sell estate property to recover unpaid medical charges (Chapter V) — a powerful enforcement mechanism
- **Rebate system**: The Medical Wants Committee could grant rebates on export duties to proprietors who independently provided adequate medical care (Section 27)

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Committee Composition**: Section 25 details (membership, chairperson, quorum) are behind the srilankalaw.lk paywall
- **Pre-Digital Amendments**: 5 of 11 amendments (1915, 1916 x2, 1946, 1966) have no digital records at all — physical gazette archives needed
- **No. 10 of 1983**: Confirmed by [srilankalaw.lk](https://www.srilankalaw.lk/m/706-medical-wants-ordinance.html) consolidated listing, but Parliament.lk search for 10/1983 returns "Metric Units" — cataloguing discrepancy, no PDF available
- **Law No. 28 of 1974**: Listed on Parliament.lk (G4138) but PDF returns 404
- **Current Relevance**: Whether the Ordinance has practical application given the transformation of Sri Lanka's plantation sector since 1912
- **Relationship to Modern Frameworks**: How estate medical care now relates to the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) and national health system
- **1990 Amendment**: The scanned PDF at documents.gov.lk needs OCR processing to determine what sections were amended
- **1993 Amendment**: No. 53 of 1993 — scanned PDF available from [Parliament.lk](https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/3256.pdf) but requires OCR processing to determine sections amended
