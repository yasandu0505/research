## Cross-References

### Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927 — Part IX Repealed

Section 27 **repeals Part IX** of the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 105), which previously governed the registration of nurses. This transfers sole regulatory authority over nursing from the Sri Lanka Medical Council to the new Nurses' Council. Pre-existing regulations made under Part IX are deemed valid under this Act until amended (S.27).

### Nursing Homes (Regulation) Act, No. 16 of 1949

Section 25(5) provides a **5-year transitional exemption** for nursing homes registered under the Nursing Homes (Regulation) Act, allowing them to employ unregistered nurses during the transition period.

### Bribery Act

Section 28 deems the Sri Lanka Nurses' Council a **"Scheduled institution"** under the Bribery Act, subjecting Council members and officers to anti-corruption provisions.
