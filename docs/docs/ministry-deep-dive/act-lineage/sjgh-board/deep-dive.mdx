## Cross-References

### Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM)

The Director of PGIM (or nominee) is an ex-officio member of the Board (S.3(1)(g)). PGIM was established under the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. This cross-appointment reflects the hospital's role as a teaching hospital linked to post-graduate medical education.

### Vijaya Kumaratunga Memorial Hospital Board Act, No. 38 of 1999

Enacted 16 years later, the VK Memorial Hospital Board Act follows a similar governance pattern — a ministerially-appointed board managing a specific hospital. The two acts are cross-referenced in the ministry ecosystem data, reflecting parallel hospital management legislation.

### Constitution of Sri Lanka — Article 154

The Board's accounts are audited by the Auditor-General under Article 154 of the Constitution (S.12), placing the hospital's finances under the same oversight framework as other public institutions.

## Regulations (Section 11)

The Minister may make regulations for:

| Subject | Detail | Section |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Consultative Committees** | Establishment of Consultative Committees for the Hospital | S.11 |
| **Staff remuneration** | Terms and conditions of service for Board employees | S.11 |
| **Admission and entry** | Restrictions on admission to and entry into the Hospital | S.11 |

- **Consultative Committees**: Whether any Consultative Committees have been established under S.11
- **Penalty adequacy**: Rs. 500 maximum fine (set in 1983) is widely regarded as inadequate; no inflation adjustment in over 40 years
- **Staff appointments**: How the Board exercises its S.7(d) staff appointment power in practice
- **PGIM relationship**: Nature and extent of the teaching hospital collaboration with PGIM
- **Comparison with VK Memorial**: How governance patterns differ between the two hospital board acts
