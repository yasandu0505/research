# Mental Disease Ordinance, No. 1 of 1873

The Mental Disease Ordinance is the oldest piece of mental health legislation in Sri Lanka, originally enacted on 9 January 1873 as the **Lunacy Ordinance**. It provides "further and better provision relating to the care and custody of persons of unsound mind and their estates." Despite being 153 years old and widely criticised as archaic, it remains the primary legislation governing involuntary mental health admission in Sri Lanka — a new Mental Health Act has been under development since 2005 but is not yet enacted.

Of 11 amendments, two have accessible scanned PDFs: [No. 14 of 1952](https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/5387.pdf) ("Lunacy Amendment") and [No. 27 of 1956](https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/3157.pdf) ("Mental Diseases Amendment" — the renaming amendment). The remaining 9 amendments are pre-digital or have source mismatches.

## Ordinance Structure

The Ordinance has a flat section structure (no chapter divisions) with 34 sections:

| Section(s) | Topic | Summary |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Preliminary | Short title |
| 2-4 | District Court Admissions | Application to court for committal, court proceedings, continued inquiry after remand |
| 5-6 | Custody & Admission | Placement in mental hospital; Minister's authority to admit non-pauper patients |
| 7 | Emergency Orders | Emergency admission powers when immediate committal is necessary |
| 8 | Release | Relative may assume custody of hospitalised person |
| 9-10 | Prisoner Provisions | Prisoners becoming unsound during sentence; proceedings after sentence expires |
| 11-12 | Financial | Property inquiry without security; maintenance costs from personal property |
| 13 | Administrative | Stamp duty exemption for proceedings under this Ordinance |
| 14 | Visitors | Appointment of Visitors to inspect mental health institutions |
| 15 | Regulations | Minister's authority to make regulations for mental hospitals |
| 16-18 | Escaped Patients | Retaking within 14 days; retaking after 14 days; absence on trial |
| 19-22 | Appeals | Right of appeal, prosecution of appeals, appeal procedures, appellate court duties |
| 23-27 | Voluntary Patients | Admission (age 16+), right to depart, notifications to relatives, discharge procedures |
| 28-31 | Temporary Patients | Admission for observation, notification requirements, detention and discharge, Director discharge authority |
| 32-34 | General | Form variation powers, interpretation, terminology substitution ("insane criminal") |

## Four Admission Types

The Ordinance establishes four distinct pathways for admission to a mental hospital:

| Type | Sections | Authority | Patient Consent | Duration |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Court Order** | 2-4 | District Court | None (involuntary) | Indefinite until court-ordered release |
| **Minister's Order** | 5-6 | Minister | None (involuntary) | Indefinite; non-pauper patients at own expense |
| **Emergency** | 7 | Magistrate / Police | None (involuntary) | Until court proceedings can be held |
| **Voluntary** | 23-27 | Self (age 16+) | Yes | Patient may leave with 72 hours notice |
| **Temporary** | 28-31 | Medical recommendation | Limited | Up to 6 months for observation |

## Statutory Bodies

**No statutory body is established by this Ordinance.** This is notable — unlike the Health Services Act (Health Council, Hospital Boards, Hospital Committees), Medical Ordinance (SLMC, College Council), and Medical Wants Ordinance (Medical Wants Committee), the Mental Disease Ordinance relies entirely on executive authority (Minister, Director) and judicial authority (District Courts).

"Visitors" appointed under Section 14 serve an inspection role but are not a constituted body — they are individual appointees without a collective governance structure, quorum, or meeting requirements.

## Amendment Timeline

The Ordinance has been amended 11 times between 1882 and 1956 — and not once in the 69 years since. This makes it the longest-unamended health legislation in Sri Lanka.

### Amendment Eras

| Era | Period | Amendments | Context |
|-----|--------|------------|---------|
| Colonial (Early) | 1882-1905 | 4 (No. 3/1882, No. 3/1883, No. 2/1889, No. 13/1905) | Victorian-era mental health law; institutional model |
| Colonial (Late) | 1919-1943 | 4 (No. 16/1919, No. 3/1940, No. 13/1940, No. 11/1943) | World War I/II periods; two amendments in 1940 |
| Post-Independence | 1952-1956 | 3 (No. 14/1952, No. 22/1955, No. 27/1956) | Transition from "Lunacy" to "Mental Diseases" |

### The 1956 Renaming

Amendment No. 27 of 1956 is the most significant — it renamed the entire Ordinance from the "Lunacy Ordinance" to the "Mental Diseases Ordinance" and added Section 34, which substituted the term "insane criminal" with updated terminology. This reflected evolving social attitudes towards mental health, though the core Victorian-era framework of the Ordinance remained unchanged.

## Entity Relationships & Governance

<EntityRelationshipView data={analysisData} />

## Historical Context

The Mental Disease Ordinance reflects 19th-century approaches to mental health:

- **Institutional model**: The Ordinance assumes a single centralised mental hospital (now NIMH at Angoda) rather than community-based care
- **Court-centred admission**: Primary admission requires District Court proceedings — a judicial rather than medical process
- **No rights framework**: The Ordinance lacks provisions for patient rights, informed consent, or treatment standards that modern mental health legislation requires
- **Custody, not treatment**: The language focuses on "care and custody" rather than treatment and recovery — reflecting the Victorian-era view of mental illness
- **NIMH (Angoda)**: The National Institute of Mental Health, the designated mental hospital, was established administratively rather than by this Ordinance; it has operated continuously since the colonial period

## Research Gaps

The following areas require further investigation:

- **Successor legislation**: A new Mental Health Act has been under development since 2005 (with WHO technical support) but has not been enacted — current status unknown
- **Visitors appointments**: Whether Visitors under Section 14 are still actively appointed and conducting inspections
- **NIMH governance**: How NIMH's day-to-day governance relates to this Ordinance versus administrative regulations
- **Pre-digital amendments**: 8 of 11 amendments (1882, 1883, 1889, 1905, 1919, 1940 x2, 1943) have no digital records — physical gazette archives needed
- **No. 22 of 1955**: Parliament.lk returns "Administrative Districts" for 22/1955 — cataloguing mismatch; actual amendment text unavailable
- **No. 14 of 1952**: Scanned PDF available from Parliament.lk but requires OCR processing to determine sections amended
- **Provincial devolution**: Whether mental health governance has been affected by the 13th Amendment's devolution of health to Provincial Councils
- **Current admission statistics**: How many admissions per year are still made under this 1873 Ordinance
