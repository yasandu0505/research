## Key Observations

- The oldest legislation dates to **1873** (Mental Disease Ordinance), while the most recent is from **2018** (1990 Suwaseriya Foundation Act)
- **4 Ordinances** predate independence (1912-1929) and remain in force
- Only the **Health Services Act** has received deep structural analysis so far
- Several acts establish standalone statutory bodies (NMRA, Nurses' Council, NATA) that warrant their own deep dives
