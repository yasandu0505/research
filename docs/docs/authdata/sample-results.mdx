# Sample Audit Results

This page showcases curated examples of audit results to help you understand what the AuthData Audit Framework produces and how pass/fail determinations are made.

## Understanding Audit Results

Each audit runs through **three phases**:

1. **Source Discovery**: Checks if the GitHub data source exists and is accessible
2. **Data Integrity**: Validates the data against configured rules (schema, row counts, data types)
3. **App Visibility**: Uses Selenium to verify the data is displayed correctly in the web UI

An audit **passes** when all three phases complete successfully. An audit **fails** if any phase fails - subsequent phases may be skipped if an earlier phase fails.

## Interactive Samples

Click on any sample below to expand it and see the detailed results for each phase. The samples include:

- **3 Passing Examples**: Successful audits with all phases passing
- **2 Failing Examples**: Common failure scenarios (missing data, UI navigation issues)

## What to Look For

### In Passing Audits

- **Source Discovery**: Shows the GitHub URL, detected columns, and row count
- **Data Integrity**: Lists each validation rule and its result
- **App Visibility**: Shows the navigation path taken through the UI and confirms data matches

### In Failing Audits

- **HTTP 404 Errors**: The dataset doesn't exist for the requested year
- **Navigation Failures**: UI elements couldn't be found (selector may be wrong or UI changed)
- **Skipped Phases**: When Source Discovery fails, subsequent phases are skipped

## Common Failure Patterns

### Missing Data Source

When a dataset doesn't exist for a particular year:

```
Error: HTTP 404: File not found. The dataset for year 2025
does not exist in the GitHub repository.
```

**Resolution**: Verify the year exists in the repository, or remove that year from the audit configuration.

### UI Navigation Failure

When Selenium can't find an expected element:

```
Error: Navigation failed: Element not found for selector
'//*[text()='Export Categories']'. The UI tree structure
may have changed or the dataset card is not visible.
```

**Resolution**: Use the `explore` command to discover the current UI structure and update selectors in the configuration.

### Data Mismatch

When UI data doesn't match GitHub source:

```
Warning: UI row count (8) doesn't match source row count (10)
```

**Resolution**: Investigate whether the UI is filtering data or if there's a synchronization issue.
