# SLAS Ministry & Institution Distribution

<span className="status-badge status-badge--alpha">ALPHA</span><span className="status-text">Early Research — AI-Extracted Data</span>

How are the 2,616 SLAS officers distributed across government institutions? This analysis normalizes the `presentWorkPlace` field from the seniority lists into institution categories and computes officer counts, grade breakdowns, and average ages.

## Normalization Rules

The `presentWorkPlace` field contains free-text institution names with varying formats. The following normalization rules are applied:

- **Divisional Secretariats** — All "Divisional Secretariat - ..." variants are grouped under a single "Divisional Secretariats (Field Administration)" category
- **District Secretariats** — Similarly grouped, including "Kachcheri" references
- **Provincial Councils** — Grouped by province where identifiable (e.g., "Chief Secretary's Office - Northern Province" → "Provincial Council - Northern Province")
- **Ministries** — Kept by full name as they appear in the data
- **Departments, Statutory Bodies, Authorities** — Kept by name
- **Blank/missing** — Mapped to "Unassigned" (4 officers across all grades)
