# SLAS Post Classification Catalog

253 raw post titles from the four SLAS seniority lists have been normalized to **100 canonical posts** and classified using the OpenGIN `kind: { major, minor }` taxonomy. Each post is assigned a **role family** (major) and a **seniority tier** (minor).

## Classification Methodology

:::info[Transparency Note]
This section documents every rule applied during normalization and classification so that any result in the catalog above can be independently verified. The source script is [`classify_posts.py`](https://github.com/lanka-data-foundation/research/blob/main/slas/scripts/classify_posts.py).
:::

### Overview

The classification pipeline has three stages, executed in strict order:

```
Raw presentPost string
  → Stage 1: Normalization  (253 raw → 100 canonical titles)
  → Stage 2: Classification (100 titles → kind.major + kind.minor)
  → Stage 3: Aggregation    (count by grade, collect raw variants)
```

Every officer record across all four grade JSONs (Special Grade, Grade I, Grade II, Grade III — 2,616 officers total) is processed through this pipeline. No records are dropped. The final sum of all post counts must equal 2,616.

---

### Stage 1: Normalization

Normalization converts the raw `presentPost` field into a clean, canonical form. It runs six sub-steps **in order**; order matters because later steps depend on earlier ones.

#### 1.1 Whitespace cleanup

- Strip leading and trailing whitespace
- Collapse all runs of multiple spaces to a single space
- *Example:* `"Commissioner  of  Agrarian  Development"` → `"Commissioner of Agrarian Development"`

#### 1.2 Typo correction

Exact string replacements fix known misspellings in the source data. Each replacement is applied using simple string substitution (not regex).

| Misspelled | Corrected | Occurrences |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Assiatnat` | `Assistant` | 26 (GIII) |
| `Assistan ` (trailing space) | `Assistant ` | 1 (GIII) |
| `Seinior` | `Senior` | 1 (GIII) |
| `Commisioner` | `Commissioner` | 2 (GII, GIII) |
| `Secretray` | `Secretary` | 2 (GIII) |
| `Sceretary` | `Secretary` | 1 (GIII) |
| `Secreatary` | `Secretary` | 1 (GIII) |
| `Seretary` | `Secretary` | 1 (SP) |
| `Estabilishment` | `Establishment` | 1 (GI) |
| `Co-operative` / `Co- operative` / `Co- Operative` | `Cooperative` | 7 |
| `Haome` | `Home` | 1 (SP) |
| `Hambanthota` | `Hambantota` | 1 (GIII) |

#### 1.3 Abbreviation expansion

Standard SLAS abbreviations are expanded to their full forms using regex patterns. The period character (`.`) is **required** in the match to prevent false positives inside full words (e.g., `Sen.` matches but `Senior` does not).

| Abbreviation | Expansion | Regex |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| `Addl.` | `Additional` | `\bAddl\.\s*` |
| `Asst.` | `Assistant` | `\bAsst\.\s*` |
| `Dy.` | `Deputy` | `\bDy\.\s*` |
| `Snr.` | `Senior` | `\bSnr\.\s*` |
| `Sen.` | `Senior` | `\bSen\.\s*` |
| `Govt.` | `Government` | `\bGovt\.\s*` |
| `Prov.` | `Provincial` | `\bProv\.\s*` |

After expansion, multiple spaces are collapsed again, and leading lowercase letters are uppercased.

#### 1.4 Structural overrides

A lookup table of ~13 entries handles cases that cannot be solved by abbreviation expansion alone:

| Raw (after steps 1.1–1.3) | Canonical form | Reason |
|---------------------------|----------------|--------|
| `District Secretary / Government Agent` | `District Secretary` | Dual-title — normalize to primary |
| `Import and Export Controller General` | `Controller General of Imports & Exports` | Reorder to standard "Controller General of..." form |
| `Municipal Commissioner (Acting)` | `Acting Municipal Commissioner` | Move "(Acting)" suffix to "Acting" prefix |
| `Additional Director General (Acting)` | `Acting Additional Director General` | Same |
| `Assistant / Deputy Director` | `Assistant Director` | Normalize slash-combined title |
| `Senior Deputy Custom Director` | `Senior Deputy Director of Customs` | Full canonical form |

#### 1.5 Geographic qualifier stripping

Post titles that include a district, province, or city name in parentheses are merged into their base post. This treats "Assistant Commissioner (Monaragala)" and "Assistant Commissioner (Galle)" as the same classified role.

**Stripped qualifiers:** Monaragala, Matara, Kalutara, Kandy, Gampaha, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Galle, Jaffna, Kantale, Ampara, Mannar, Trincomalee, Hambantota, Harispaththuwa, Galigamuwa, Katana, Kilinochchi, Polonnaruwa, Colombo, Kurunegala, Matale, Puttalam, Uva, North Central, North Western, Central, SLC.

**Not stripped:** Functional qualifiers like `(Administration)`, `(SLAS)`, `(LLDA)`, `(Personnel & Training)` are kept where needed or handled by the role-title normalization table (step 1.6).

Trailing Roman numeral suffixes (` - I`, ` - II`) are also removed.

#### 1.6 Role-title normalization

The largest normalization table (~150 entries) maps domain-specific long titles to canonical short forms. The full list of rules falls into these categories:

**Directors** — All specialized Director variants (parenthetical divisions, department names) collapse to the base tier:
- `Director (Combined Service)`, `Director (HRD)`, `Director (Establishment)`, `Director (SLAS)`, etc. → `Director`
- `Director General - Establishment`, `Director General (World Food Programme)` → `Director General`
- `District Director`, `Managing Director`, `Executive Director` → `Director`

**Commissioners** — Domain-specific commissioner titles collapse to base:
- `Commissioner of Labour`, `Commissioner of Local Government`, `Commissioner of Cooperative Development` → `Commissioner`
- `Commissioner General of Ayurveda`, `Commissioner General of Labour` → `Commissioner General`
- `Deputy Commissioner of Labour`, `Deputy Commissioner of Excise` → `Deputy Commissioner`
- `Assistant Commissioner of Labour`, `Assistant Commissioner of Local Government` → `Assistant Commissioner`

**Provincial** — Provincial role variants collapse:
- `Provincial Director of Rural Development`, `Provincial Director of Sports`, `Provincial Director of Textile` → `Provincial Director`
- All four spelling variants of `Provincial Commissioner of Probation & Child Care` → `Provincial Commissioner`

**Secretariat** — Deputy Chief Secretary variants (different parenthetical qualifiers for Administration, Personnel & Training) collapse:
- `Deputy Chief Secretary (Administration)`, `Deputy Chief Secretary (Personnel & Training)`, etc. → `Deputy Chief Secretary`
- `Senior Assistant Secretary (HR)`, `Senior Assistant Secretary (Project Management Unit)` → `Senior Assistant Secretary`
- `Additional District Secretary (Land)`, `Additional District Secretary (Admin)` → `Additional District Secretary`

**Regulatory/Statutory** — Specialty statutory roles keep their distinct identity:
- `Immigration & Emigration Controller General` — kept as-is
- `Director of Customs`, `Senior Deputy Director of Customs` — kept as-is
- `Comptroller General`, `Registrar General`, `Postmaster General` — kept as-is

The raw variants that mapped to each canonical post are preserved in the `rawVariants` array of the output JSON and can be inspected by clicking the expand arrow in the catalog table.

### Stage 2: Classification

After normalization, each canonical post title is classified into a two-dimensional taxonomy: `kind.major` (role family) and `kind.minor` (seniority tier).

#### The "Acting" prefix rule

If a normalized title starts with `"Acting "`, the prefix is stripped for the purpose of determining `kind.major`, and `kind.minor` is forced to `"acting"` regardless of what the base title would otherwise produce. This means:

- `Acting Divisional Secretary` → major = `FieldAdministration` (from "Divisional Secretary"), minor = `acting`
- `Acting Director General` → major = `Directorate` (from "Director General"), minor = `acting`

#### Major classification — Evaluation order

The classifier tests keyword conditions against the (prefix-stripped) title in the following **priority order**. The first match wins. This order is critical because some titles contain overlapping keywords (e.g., "Divisional Secretary" contains "Secretary").

```
1. NonActive         — exact match: Attached, Compulsory Leave, Foreign Mission, Interdicted, Leave
2. FieldAdministration — contains "divisional secretary" OR "district secretary"
3. Municipal         — contains "municipal"
4. Provincial        — contains "provincial"
5. Commission        — contains "commissioner"
6. Secretariat       — contains "secretary"
7. Directorate       — contains "director"
8. Regulatory        — matches any of: controller, registrar, inspector general,
                       customs, immigration, competent authority, general manager,
                       postmaster, survey general, government printer, comptroller,
                       conservator, chief operating officer, consultant, auditor
9. Fallback          — Regulatory (for any unmatched title)
```

**Why this order matters:**

| Title | Without priority | With priority |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| `Divisional Secretary` | Secretariat (matches "secretary") | **FieldAdministration** (step 2 matches first) |
| `Municipal Commissioner` | Commission (matches "commissioner") | **Municipal** (step 3 matches first) |
| `Provincial Director` | Directorate (matches "director") | **Provincial** (step 4 matches first) |
| `Provincial Commissioner` | Commission (matches "commissioner") | **Provincial** (step 4 matches first) |

#### Minor classification — Within each major

Once the major family is determined, the seniority tier is assigned based on prefix/qualifier keywords in the title:

**FieldAdministration:**

| Condition | Minor | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Title contains "additional district" | `additional` | Additional District Secretary |

| "chief secretary" (plain) | `head` | Chief Secretary |
| "additional secretary" | `additional` | Additional Secretary |
| "deputy secretary" | `deputy` | Deputy Secretary of the Treasury |

| "senior" | `senior` | (Senior Deputy treated separately) |
| "additional" | `additional` | Additional Director |
| "regional director" | `standard` | Regional Director |
| All others | `standard` | Director, Director of Customs |

**Regulatory:**

| Condition (tested in order) | Minor | Example |

| Generic "assistant" | `assistant` | Assistant Consultant |
| Generic "senior" | `senior` | Senior Consultant |
| All others | `standard` | Immigration & Emigration Controller, Consultant |

**NonActive** — all non-active statuses receive `minor: "standard"`.

### Stage 3: Aggregation

After every officer record is normalized and classified:

1. Officers sharing the same normalized title are grouped together
2. For each group, the following are computed:
   - `count.total` — total officers holding this post across all grades
   - `count.SP`, `count.GI`, `count.GII`, `count.GIII` — breakdown by SLAS grade
   - `rawVariants` — sorted list of distinct raw strings that mapped to this normalized title
3. Groups are sorted by `count.total` descending
4. A stable `id` is generated from the normalized title by lowercasing and replacing non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
5. Summary statistics (`byMajor`, `byMinor`, `byGrade`) are computed by summing across all posts
6. The total across all posts is verified to equal **2,616** (assertion in the script)

---

### Known Limitations

1. **Geographic detail is lost.** "Assistant Commissioner (Monaragala)" and "Assistant Commissioner (Galle)" are merged into one canonical "Assistant Commissioner" post. The raw variants preserve the original strings, but the classification and count treat them identically.

2. **"Acting" overrides seniority.** An "Acting Director General" is classified with `minor: "acting"` rather than `minor: "head"`. This is a design choice — it signals the appointment is temporary — but it means the tier distribution does not reflect the *effective* seniority of acting appointments.

3. **Fallback to Regulatory.** Any title that does not match the first seven major families falls into `Regulatory`. In the current dataset this captures roles like `Consultant`, `Chief Operating Officer`, and `Conservator of Forest`, which are arguably miscellaneous rather than regulatory. The fallback is intentional to ensure no officer is left unclassified.

4. **Normalization is rule-based.** The typo and abbreviation tables were compiled by manual inspection of all 253 raw variants. New seniority lists may introduce new misspellings or abbreviation styles that are not yet covered.
